# StardewCamera (MonoGame)

This project replicates the camera system used in Stardew Valley.  
It allows pixel art games to render nicely at any resolution by smoothing gently on non-integer scales.  
The window resizing behavior also follow the same system as Stardew Valley.

**Note:** The textures used are from *Haunted Chocolatier* by ConcernedApe, used here for educational purposes only.
